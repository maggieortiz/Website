<h2>
Summary</h2>
<p>
I am a recent graduate of Bioengineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. I am currently working as a Quality Assurance Engineer Consultant for Cognizant at 
Johnson & Johnson. My current position allows me to code test automation scripts in Java/Selenium and VBScript/UFT for a web application and write SQL query for back-end Teradata verification.
 I am looking to further my career by using my knowledge of medical product design, microcontroller programming, signal aquisition and my coding skills to develop ground breaking medical devices.
