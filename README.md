I created a website when I was developing my HTML/CSS skills. 

Pages: 
- Main Page - slide show of different pages 
- Travel - map with markers of different places i have visited
- Skills - list of technical skills
- Education - College degree and Online certifications
- Projects 
    - CAD Projects - Fusion 360 projects
    - Data Engineering Project - Udacity Natural Disaster & Co2 emission project information
- Work Experience - professional work experience 


*Note* not all information is up to date but it is a display of some of my web development skills.
