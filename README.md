# Website

I created a website when I was developing my HTML/CSS skills. 

Pages: 
- Main Page - slide show of different pages 
- Travel
- Skills
- Education
- Projects 
    - CAD Projects
    - Data Engineering Project 
- Work Experience


*Note* not all information is up to date but it is a display of some of my web development skills.
